#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages like Fortran (1957) and C (1972), which made programming more efficient. 
The establishment of software engineering as a formal discipline in 1968, recognizing the need for systematic practices.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, which improved code organization and readability.
The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s, which introduced flexibility and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next while Agile is an iterative and flexible approach, delivering working software in small increments and adapting to changes throughout the project.
Waterfall: Ideal for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where the technology is well understood, such as simple websites or hardware development.
Agile: Suitable for projects where requirements are likely to change or evolve, such as software development, mobile app development, or projects involving complex technologies where rapid adaptation and flexibility are crucial.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) tracks changes to source code and coordinates work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best response from your robot or AI.
It helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Give me information about social media. 
Provide a summary of the impact of social media on mental health, including both positive and negative effects. Focus on studies from the past five years and mention any demographic trends or key statistics.
The improved prompt is more effective because it narrows the topic to the impact of social media on mental health, specifies the timeframe (past five years), and asks for both positive and negative effects, along with demographic trends and key statistics. This clarity ensures that the information provided is relevant, focused, and meets the specific needs of the requester.
